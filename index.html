  <h2>Proposition: Advanced Economies Remain Major Contributors to GHG Emissions</h2>

  <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="PRO_percapita_avg.png" alt="Per-Capita Emissions Bar Chart">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Per-capita GHG emissions (2010–2023). Advanced economies emit ≈2.2x more CO₂ per person compared to emerging & developing economies.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Framing emissions per-capita instead of totals</strong> (Score: +1.5): Reframes toward fairness/responsibility; highlights disparity per person.</li>
    <li><strong>Explicit annotation “AE ≈ 2.2× higher”</strong> (Score: +1): Makes the key gap clear at a glance; persuasive but transparent.</li>
    <li><strong>Strong contrasting colors (blue vs. orange)</strong> (Score: +2): Consistent coding enhances readability; earnest design choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Title/subtitle emphasizing disparity</strong> (Score: +0.5): Guides interpretation without misstating data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="CON_index_2010.png" alt="Indexed Growth Since 2010 Line Chart">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Indexed emissions growth (2010=100). Since 2010, emerging & developing economies rose +31% while advanced economies declined −15%.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indexing emissions to a 2010 baseline</strong> (Score: −1.5): Shifts focus from absolute responsibility to relative growth; can exaggerate EMDE increase.</li>
    <li><strong>Shaded gap between lines</strong> (Score: −1): Visually emphasizes divergence, nudging attention to EMDE growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Percent-change annotations (+31% vs −15%)</strong> (Score: +1): Direct labels reinforce interpretation; persuasive but factually accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Dashed baseline at 100</strong> (Score: +2): Neutral reference line; earnest choice that helps reading.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Designing these two visualizations highlighted how small choices in framing and encoding can dramatically shift the story that viewers take away. 
    The per-capita emissions chart was straightforward: the data itself clearly showed a large gap between advanced and emerging economies, so the challenge was mostly about communicating that disparity clearly and persuasively. 
    Adding the “≈2.2× higher” annotation and framing the comparison per person rather than by total emissions made the message much more impactful. 
    What surprised me was how much the framing choice itself (per-capita vs. total) could reshape the narrative without altering the underlying numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The indexed growth visualization was more difficult, because it required deliberately choosing a representation that downplays absolute responsibility and instead emphasizes relative growth. 
    By normalizing both groups to 2010=100, the visualization shifts the focus toward emerging economies as the main driver of growth, even though advanced economies remain substantial contributors. 
    The shaded gap and percent-change labels added persuasive power, but also pushed the design closer to being deceptive. 
    This exercise showed me how easy it is to steer interpretation simply by choosing baselines or normalization methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this process, I’ve come to define “ethical visualization” as one that balances clarity and persuasion without misrepresenting the data. 
    Acceptable persuasion includes emphasizing comparisons or annotating key insights, as long as the message is faithful to the data. 
    Misleading designs, however, hide or distort important context—such as ignoring absolute contributions when showing indexed growth. 
    The boundary is not always sharp, but reflecting on both sides made me more aware of the responsibility in presenting data: every design choice carries rhetorical weight, and those choices should be transparent and defensible.
