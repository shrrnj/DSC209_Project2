  <h1>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization</h1>
  <p><strong>Sahra Ranjbar</strong></p>

  <h2>Proposition: Advanced Economies Remain Major Contributors to GHG Emissions</h2>

  <!-- PRO Visualization -->
  <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="PRO_percapita_avg.png" alt="Per-Capita GHG Emissions (2010–2023)">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Per-capita GHG emissions (2010–2023). Advanced economies emit ≈2.2× more CO₂ per person compared to emerging & developing economies.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Design Decisions and Rationale</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Framing emissions per-capita instead of totals (Score: +1.5):</strong> Reframes the debate toward fairness and responsibility. While advanced economies do not have the highest total emissions, looking per person makes them stand out. Persuasive but still earnest.</li>
    <li><strong>Explicit annotation “AE ≈ 2.2× higher” (Score: +1):</strong> Ensures the key point is clear to viewers. Slightly persuasive in wording, but transparent.</li>
    <li><strong>Strong contrasting colors (Score: +2):</strong> Clear, consistent coding (blue vs. orange) enhances readability. Fully earnest design choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Title/subtitle emphasizing disparity (Score: +0.5):</strong> Highlights the difference to guide interpretation. Persuasive, but not misleading.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- CON Visualization -->
  <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="CON_index_2010.png" alt="Indexed Growth in Emissions (2010=100)">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Indexed emissions growth (2010=100). Since 2010, emerging & developing economies rose +31% while advanced economies declined −15%.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Design Decisions and Rationale</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indexing emissions to 2010 baseline (Score: −1.5):</strong> Normalization shifts focus from absolute responsibility to relative growth, exaggerating EMDE’s increase. Selective framing, leaning deceptive.</li>
    <li><strong>Shaded area between lines (Score: −1):</strong> Emphasizes divergence visually, making EMDE’s growth appear dominant. Persuasive but not neutral.</li>
    <li><strong>Percent-change annotations (+31% vs −15%) (Score: +1):</strong> Direct labels reinforce interpretation. Persuasive but factually accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Dashed baseline at 100 (Score: +2):</strong> Provides a neutral point of reference. Fully earnest design choice.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Final Reflection -->
  <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Designing these two visualizations highlighted how small choices in framing and encoding can dramatically shift the story that viewers take away. 
    The per-capita emissions chart was straightforward: the data itself clearly showed a large gap between advanced and emerging economies, so the challenge 
    was mostly about communicating that disparity clearly and persuasively. Adding the “≈2.2× higher” annotation and framing the comparison per person rather 
    than by total emissions made the message much more impactful. What surprised me was how much the framing choice itself (per-capita vs. total) could reshape 
    the narrative without altering the underlying numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The indexed growth visualization was more difficult, because it required deliberately choosing a representation that downplays absolute responsibility 
    and instead emphasizes relative growth. By normalizing both groups to 2010=100, the visualization shifts the focus toward emerging economies as the main 
    driver of growth, even though advanced economies remain substantial contributors. The shaded gap and percent-change labels added persuasive power, but 
    also pushed the design closer to being deceptive. This exercise showed me how easy it is to steer interpretation simply by choosing baselines or 
    normalization methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this process, I’ve come to define “ethical visualization” as one that balances clarity and persuasion without misrepresenting the data. 
    Acceptable persuasion includes emphasizing comparisons or annotating key insights, as long as the message is faithful to the data. Misleading designs, 
    however, hide or distort important context—such as ignoring absolute contributions when showing indexed growth. The boundary is not always sharp, 
    but reflecting on both sides made me more aware of the responsibility in presenting data: every design choice carries rhetorical weight, and those 
    choices should be transparent and defensible.
